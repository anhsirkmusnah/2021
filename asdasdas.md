You're absolutely right to seek a **deeper, systems-level understanding**—real HPC optimization is not about isolated tweaks but about how **compute**, **memory**, and **distribution** interact *across stack layers*. Let’s build this from the **ground up**, showing how each layer influences and depends on the others—and where bottlenecks or inefficiencies can cascade.

## 🔧 Layer Breakdown: From Algorithm to Orchestration

### 🧩 Summary Table

| Layer                              | Focus                                     | Key Concern                                | Dependency on Lower Layers                                         |

## ⛓️ **Layer-by-Layer with Interdependencies**

---

### 🔢 **L1. Mathematical Model**

> *You can't parallelize what is inherently serial.*

* **Example**: 100-qubit quantum MPS simulation has serial gate dependencies—so only parts of it can be parallelized (e.g., measuring each qubit's observables independently).
* **Impact on other layers**:

  * Parallelism in L6 is only possible **if observables or branches are decoupled**.
  * Algorithmic awareness must inform what gets distributed (vs. kept local).

---

### 🧮 **L2. Algorithm Decomposition**

> *This is the first level where HPC is applied meaningfully.*

* **Example**: Break `circuit_xyz_exp` into 100 independent site expectation evaluations.

* **Key Choice**: Do you split by **qubit**, by **circuit layer**, or by **time evolution step**?

* **Bad split**:

  * Uneven time per unit of work → idle MPI ranks.
  * Wrong data ownership (e.g., tensor data sits on one rank, other ranks idle waiting for broadcast).

* **Dependencies**:

  * Must be informed by L1 data dependencies.
  * Must feed cleanly into L6 (so MPI can divide and conquer properly).

---

### ⚛️ **L3. Memory Model (Code-Level Awareness)**

> *Memory locality is often more important than FLOPS.*

* **NUMA Pitfall**: Even if MPI divides work evenly, if all ranks on a socket pull memory from a remote node, you get 3–5× **memory latency stalls**.
* **SVD Pitfall**: Temporaries and buffers in LAPACK (e.g., `GESDD`) are large. If mallocs go unmanaged, they may span across NUMA nodes, reducing cache efficiency.

#### ✅ Example Optimization

```cpp
omp_set_num_threads(24); // Bound threads to L1/L2 cache per socket
// Use memory pools or thread-local temp buffers
```

* **Interdependency**:

  * If `maxDim` is too large (L4), memory per core spikes.
  * Without NUMA-aware allocators or `numactl`, the distributed efficiency drops—especially for big contractions (e.g., 10Kx10K SVDs).

---

### 🔄 **L4. Tensor Ops (MPS, SVD, QR, etc.)**

> *The code must call optimized primitives aligned with system bandwidth limits.*

* **Switching to `GESDD`**: reduces memory peak and improves speed by \~2x for large tensors.
* **Truncation (`Cutoff`)**: reduces downstream contraction sizes → directly impacts memory and time.

#### 💡 Code Example:

```cpp
auto args = Args("Cutoff=", 1e-12, "MaxDim=", 1024);
psi = applyGates(gates, psi, args); // small SVDs after truncation
```

* **Interdependency**:

  * If L2 overloads a rank with a huge contraction, L4 will bottleneck memory or time.
  * Must ensure L4 call patterns are **regular**, **aligned**, and **batched** if possible.

---

### 🧵 **L5. Threading & Concurrency**

> *Each MPI rank should still be multithreaded internally.*

* **OpenMP + ITensor** (experimental): internally many BLAS/LAPACK calls can multithread.
* **Pitfall**: Threads oversubscribe if MPI is not launched with `--bind-to core`.

#### Example (bad):

```bash
mpirun -np 24 ./simulate
# each of 24 MPI ranks tries to spawn 24 threads: 576 threads on a 96-core box
```

#### Fix:

```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
mpirun -np 24 --bind-to core ./simulate
```

* **Interdependency**:

  * Without tuning, memory thrashing and cache contention offset any threading gains.
  * Layer 4 must allow batched ops to make threading meaningful (SVDs too small = poor scaling).

---

### 🌐 **L6. Distributed Compute (MPI, Sharding)**

> *Workload division must match both algorithm and memory characteristics.*

* **MPI parallelism is ideal for site-based contractions** or independent circuit executions.
* **Use `MPI_Gatherv`** or **scatter** to avoid copying large tensors unnecessarily.

#### Code Example (in `circuit_xyz_exp`):

```cpp
int base = no_sites / nproc;
int rem  = no_sites % nproc;
int start = rank * base + std::min(rank, rem);
```

* **Interdependency**:

  * If L2 divides work unevenly, MPI ranks idle or crash.
  * L3–L5 must provide **isolated work units** to maximize distribution.

---

### ☁️ **L7. Orchestration (Slurm, Kubernetes, Docker)**

> *Even perfect code fails if job placement mismatches the memory and thread model.*

* **Bad example**: Slurm allocates 96 cores across 3 nodes, but MPI assumes shared memory.
* **NUMA-aware execution** must be requested (e.g., via `numactl`, `--cpu-bind`).

#### Dockerfile Example:

```dockerfile
ENV OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
CMD mpirun -n 24 --bind-to core python3 main.py
```

* **Interdependency**:

  * If L6–L5 assume shared L3 cache but orchestration spans NUMA domains, performance drops.
  * All assumptions about SVD sizes (L4) and concurrency (L5) hinge on correct job layout.

## ✅ Best Practice: Full-Stack Co-Design

| Layer | Example Best Practice                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| L1    | Express gate model to expose site-level parallelism        |
| L2    | Decompose `circuit_xyz_exp` across sites, not layers       |
| L3    | Use NUMA-aware allocators or thread-local storage          |
| L4    | Switch to `GESDD`, apply tighter cutoffs                   |
| L5    | Pin threads, set `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, avoid oversubscription |
| L6    | Balance MPI ranks by work, not just qubit count            |
| L7    | Pin jobs to sockets; use Slurm/K8s topology awareness      |

## 🧠 Final Thought

HPC optimization **isn't parallelism alone**—it's a dance between **data layout, compute capability, memory bandwidth, and orchestration**. One bad assumption (e.g., unbalanced work split or NUMA-ignorant malloc) can nullify all other gains.

Would you like a visual dependency map or a diagnostic checklist for when performance goes wrong?
