Productivity Suite – Achievements and Work Performed

– Identified a severe vulnerability in the file-upload data-classification filter and created a proof-of-concept codebase to replicate the exploit and drive the fix with engineering and security teams.

– Performed an end-to-end optimization study of the RAG pipeline, including PDF parsing, text extraction, map-reduce and master-slave extraction patterns for large PDFs, chunking strategies, and evaluation of multiple embedding models. Designed conditional multiplexer-based embedding and chunking strategies based on document type, text length, and semantic content.

– Built a proof of concept to integrate enterprise services like JIRA and Confluence into an agentic mesh using an MCP wrapper on top of the open-source Solace agentic mesh framework.

– Conducted a quantitative and qualitative assessment of cloud-native, FOSS, and proprietary PDF parsing libraries and services. Evaluated parsing accuracy across edge cases such as ASCII encoding issues, OCR quality, tabular extraction fidelity, and layout preservation.

– Designed and implemented a high-performance, distributed PDF parsing pipeline using PyMuPDF with parallel page processing, configurable image extraction, full OCR-enabled parsing, and multiple output formats including JSON and Markdown. Added comprehensive telemetry, benchmarking utilities, AGPL-3 compliance checks, and AWS-ready templates for integration with the Productivity Suite.

Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning – Distributed and High Performance Compute Pipeline

– Iterated on and improved the Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning (QiML) pipeline architecture for the enterprise Fraud Detection use case across multiple development cycles.

– Designed and built an enterprise-ready QiML operations pipeline capable of large-scale training, validation, and inference under strict business-defined latency and infrastructure constraints.

– Architected a funnel-based QiML design approach that accounts for algorithmic structure, memory and compute constraints, cloud topology, and inference requirements, ensuring all layers remain topology-aware and performance-optimized.

– Refactored a monolithic quantum gate and circuit simulation codebase into a distributed, HPC-enabled implementation using SVD optimization, memory-aware scheduling, and compute-efficient execution for improved training and inference times.

– Researched and benchmarked alternative quantum and tensor-network libraries such as iTensor, Qiskit, PennyLane, and CUDA-based quantum libraries to validate architectural decisions and identify performance advantages.

– Conducted exploratory research across the full QiML stack: quantum simulation algorithms, supporting libraries, gate and circuit structures suitable for fraud detection, and the integration of classical ML components to identify the optimal architecture for anomaly detection.

– Executed, logged, and documented multiple end-to-end QiML runs on large-scale fraud datasets. Compared results against business metrics and collaborated with stakeholders to validate performance, accuracy, and operational feasibility.
